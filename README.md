> A Next.js boilerplate with extra libraries and tools added to give a more feature full start to new next.js projects without needing the time to add all of them manually. ðŸ¥³

## Motivation

Next.js is an amazing framework and I use it on the daily basis but the default boilerplate did not fulfil my needs after some time, it became time consuming to start a new project since it needed me to add lots of things to it like linting and testing before actually starting the development process. So I decided to create a boilerplate that has all of the features that I like and use to start projects fast and for other people to use it as well.

## Installation

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ixahmedxi/next-boilerpack <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visiting `http://localhost:3000` should then result in seeing the same thing as the docs website.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://next-boilerpack.vercel.app/) for using and confiuguring the boilerplate to your liking can be found on the [official website](https://next-boilerpack.vercel.app/) of the project.

## Have Fun

Create something magical and most importantly have fun in the process. I would love it if you [tweet me](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii) your creations using this boilerplate as your starting point and I will do my best to always keep it up to date.
